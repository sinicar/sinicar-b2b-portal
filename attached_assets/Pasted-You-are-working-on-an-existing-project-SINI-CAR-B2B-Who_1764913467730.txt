You are working on an existing project:

SINI CAR – B2B Wholesale Customer Portal
(React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + mockApi + LocalStorage + i18n AR/EN/HI/ZH)

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT delete, rewrite, or refactor any code yet.

Your job in this task is ANALYSIS and DOCUMENTATION only.

Read the entire project first, then produce a complete technical map and report.

Your goal is to:

Generate a FULL TECHNICAL MAP of the project (frontend only, current version with mockApi + LocalStorage).

Perform a FULL STATIC CHECK of the project (code structure, TypeScript errors, imports, routes, etc.).

Produce the documentation and data that we can give to backend developers and other programmers later.

Think like a senior lead engineer who is documenting an existing system.

PHASE 1 — READ AND UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT

Scan ALL source files:

src/

components, pages, layouts

models / types

mockApi / services / db.ts

hooks, context

i18n files

any docs or config files related to routes or data.

Identify:

The main entry points (e.g., main.tsx, App.tsx, router files).

How routing is organized (React Router or custom).

How state management is done (Context, hooks, any global store).

How mockApi and LocalStorage are wired into the app.

Where roles/permissions are defined and used.

Where major modules live (Trader Tools, Supplier Marketplace, Advertising, Installments, Teams/Organizations, etc.).

Do not modify any files yet. Just read and understand.

PHASE 2 — PROJECT OVERVIEW DOCUMENT

Create a detailed System Overview (in English) covering at least:

Tech Stack:

Framework (React + Vite)

Language (TypeScript)

Styling (Tailwind via CDN)

Data layer (mockApi + LocalStorage)

i18n implementation (AR/EN/HI/ZH)

Main Modules / Domains:
At minimum, describe each of these (if present in the code):

Admin Portal

Customer Portal (Wholesale Customers)

Supplier Marketplace

Advertising System (Advertisers, Campaigns, AdSlots)

Trader Tools (PDF→Excel, VIN extraction, Price Comparison)

Installment Wholesale Requests (credit/instalments)

Team & Sub-Users per Organization (Customers, Suppliers, Advertisers, Affiliates)

Settings / Configuration Hub

Authentication / User Management

Logging / Activity (if any implemented)

For each module:

What it does.

Which files/folders it lives in.

How it connects to other modules.

User Roles and Portals:

List all user types that the system currently supports in code:

Admin / SINI CAR owner

Wholesale Customer

Supplier

Advertiser

Affiliate / Marketer

Employees / Sub-Users (organization team members)

Explain how each role enters the system (login, portal).

Explain what each role can see/do based on the current implementation.

Output this as a structured text document with headings and bullet points.

PHASE 3 — FILE & ROUTE MAP

Generate a detailed file and route map of the project:

Folder and file tree:

Provide a tree-like view of src/ with:

pages

components

models/types

api/mockApi

hooks

context

i18n

For each MAIN folder, explain its purpose in one or two sentences.

Routes:

List all routes in the application (e.g., /admin/..., /customer/..., /supplier/..., /advertiser/..., etc.).

For each route:

path

component file

main features on that page

which role(s) are allowed to access it (if enforced in code)

related models / data used on that page

Components:

Identify key shared components (tables, forms, layouts, tabs, modal components).

Briefly explain what each reusable component is used for.

PHASE 4 — DATA MODELS AND LOCALSTORAGE KEYS

Extract and document ALL important TypeScript interfaces/types and LocalStorage keys:

Models / Interfaces:

List all core business models, such as:

Customer

Supplier

Product

Quote / Order

InstallmentRequest / InstallmentOffer / PaymentSchedule

Advertiser / AdCampaign / AdSlot

Organization / OrganizationUser / Permissions

User / Role

Any others you find.

For each model:

Show the interface definition.

Explain the meaning of each field in simple terms.

Explain how and where this model is used in the app.

LocalStorage usage:

List all LocalStorage keys used (e.g., "customers", "suppliers", "adCampaigns", "installmentRequests", "organizations", "auth", etc.).

For each key:

What type of data is stored (which interface).

Which components/pages read/write this data.

How the data lifecycle works (create, update, delete).

mockApi:

Document all mockApi functions:

e.g., getCustomers, createCustomer, updateCustomer, getInstallmentRequests, createAdCampaign, etc.

For each function:

Input parameters

Return type

Which LocalStorage key it uses

Which pages call it

Produce this as a section called “Data Model & Storage Reference” — this is crucial for backend developers.

PHASE 5 — WORKFLOW DOCUMENTATION (BUSINESS FLOWS)

For each major business flow that is already implemented in code, write a clear step-by-step description.

At minimum cover:

Installment Wholesale Request Flow:

How a customer creates an installment request.

What status values exist in the code.

How SINI CAR sees and handles the request (approve full, approve partial, reject).

How/if forwarding to suppliers is wired right now.

How offers are stored and how the customer accepts/rejects them (if implemented).

Where in the code this logic lives (files, components, functions).

Advertising Flow:

How advertisers and campaigns are created/managed.

How AdSlots are configured.

How ads are selected for display (if any logic exists).

Where it connects to the customer portal UI.

Trader Tools Flow:

Which tools are implemented (PDF→Excel, VIN, Price Comparison).

Where their settings and usage logs are stored.

How they are exposed to customers.

Supplier Marketplace Flow:

How suppliers are managed.

How requests/offers pass through suppliers (if implemented).

Team & Permissions Flow:

How organizations and sub-users are represented.

How scoped permissions are used in code to hide/show features.

How teams are managed per organization type (if implemented).

For each flow:

List the main TSX/TS files involved.

Describe the sequence of calls (UI → mockApi → LocalStorage).

This documentation should be suitable for a backend developer to understand how to mirror this logic in a real API.

PHASE 6 — FULL STATIC CHECK & CODE HEALTH REPORT

Perform a complete static check of the project:

TypeScript / Compilation:

Check for any TypeScript errors.

Check for any obvious type mismatches or implicit any where it should be stricter.

List any compilation warnings or errors.

Imports and Dead Code:

Identify unused imports.

Identify unused components, types, or functions.

Identify any duplicate logic that could be reused or centralized later (just note; do not refactor now).

Routing and Navigation:

Check for routes that exist in code but are not reachable.

Check for components with buttons/links that don’t trigger any handler or route.

Note any broken navigation patterns.

Performance / Structure (High-Level):

Without changing code, give a short analysis:

Where the app might be doing too many re-renders.

Where very large components could be split (just suggestions).

Any obvious heavy operations in UI (e.g., parsing huge data in render).

Produce a Code Health Report with:

Issues found

Their location (file/line if possible)

Suggested high-level fixes (for future work, not to implement now)

PHASE 7 — WHAT TO HAND TO BACKEND DEVELOPERS (DELIVERABLES LIST)

From everything you analysed, produce a final section called:

“PACKAGE FOR BACKEND DEVELOPERS”

This must include a clear list of what we can hand over to backend/architecture engineers, including:

System Overview:

Summary of modules, roles, and flows.

Data Models Summary:

List of all core interfaces and what they represent.

Suggest which of these should become database tables.

Suggest relationships (e.g., one InstallmentRequest has many InstallmentOffer, one Organization has many OrganizationUser, etc.).

Potential Database Schema Sketch:

A high-level proposal of tables and relationships based on current models.

This is not actual SQL, but a conceptual map:

users

organizations

organization_users

customers

suppliers

advertisers

affiliates

installment_requests

installment_offers

ad_campaigns

ad_slots

etc.

Potential API Endpoints (List Only):

For each major model/flow, list what REST endpoints would likely be needed, e.g.:

/api/customers

/api/suppliers

/api/installment-requests

/api/installment-offers

/api/ad-campaigns

/api/organizations

Include the basic operations (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) at a conceptual level.

Notes/Assumptions:

Any assumptions you had to make while documenting (e.g. incomplete flows).

Any TODOs or gaps in the current app that backend developers should be aware of.

The goal: after reading this “PACKAGE FOR BACKEND DEVELOPERS”, a backend engineer should understand:

What data exists.

How it is used in the UI.

What flows they need to support.

How to design DB + API to replace mockApi + LocalStorage.

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

Do NOT modify or refactor the project in this task.

Do NOT remove mockApi or LocalStorage — only document them.

Focus on producing:

A complete system overview

A clear file and route map

A thorough data model reference

A code health report

A backend handover package (data models, flows, possible DB + API outline)

Output everything as structured text (with headings and lists) so it can be copied and shared with other developers.

END OF SPECIFICATION.
