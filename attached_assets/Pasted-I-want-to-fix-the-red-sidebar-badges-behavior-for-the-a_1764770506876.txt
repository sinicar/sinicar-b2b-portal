I want to fix the red sidebar badges behavior for the admin dashboard.

Currently, the red badges (counters) next to:
- طلبات العملاء
- طلبات الحسابات
- طلبات الاستيراد
- النواقص (Missing)
(and any similar sections)
do NOT clear after the page is opened.

Please implement a proper "unread/new items" logic so that:

1) Data model:
   - For each relevant entity (customerRequests, accountRequests, importRequests, missingParts, etc.), add a boolean field or timestamp flag, e.g.:
     - isNew: boolean
     - or seenAt: Date | null
   - Store these flags in mockApi/localStorage so they persist across reloads.

2) Badge calculation:
   - The red badge number for each menu item should be:
     - the count of items where isNew === true
     - (or seenAt === null) for that section.
   - Do NOT use the total count of items; only count "new/unseen" records.

3) Mark as seen on page open:
   - When the admin navigates to a section page (e.g. account requests page, customer requests page, missing parts page, import requests page):
     - On page mount (useEffect), call a function in mockApi/service layer like:
       - markAllAsSeen('accountRequests')
       - markAllAsSeen('customerRequests')
       - markAllAsSeen('missingParts')
       - etc.
     - This function should update all relevant records:
       - isNew = false
       - or seenAt = now
     - After that, update the local state/context so the badge count becomes zero immediately for that section.

4) New items:
   - When a new request is created (new account request, new customer request, new missing part search, etc.), set:
     - isNew = true
     - seenAt = null
   - This should automatically increase the corresponding badge on the sidebar.

5) Implementation details:
   - Create a small notification/badge service or context that:
     - reads the counts from mockApi
     - exposes a hook like useSidebarBadges()
     - updates the sidebar badges when data changes.
   - Make sure all badge logic is centralized and not duplicated in each page.

6) UX:
   - As soon as the page is opened and data is marked as seen, the red badge next to that sidebar item should disappear (or show 0) without needing a full reload.
   - Verify this behavior for:
     - طلبات العملاء
     - طلبات الحسابات
     - طلبات الاستيراد
     - النواقص (Missing)
     - and any similar sections with badges.

7) After implementation, run the app, open each page, and confirm:
   - badges appear only when there are new items
   - badges clear correctly after the admin opens the corresponding page.
