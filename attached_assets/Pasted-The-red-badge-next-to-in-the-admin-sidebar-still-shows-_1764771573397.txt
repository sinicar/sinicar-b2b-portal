The red badge next to "طلبات العملاء" in the admin sidebar still shows a value (e.g. 1) even after I open the Customer Requests page and view all records. I want this badge to behave like a proper "unread" counter, not a total count.

Please implement the following behavior for "طلبات العملاء" (and reuse it for the other sections later if possible):

1) Data model:
   - In the mockApi / localStorage data for customer requests, add an `isNew: boolean` field (or `seenAt: Date | null`) to each request.
   - When a new customer request is created, set:
     - isNew = true
     - seenAt = null

2) Mark as seen when page opens:
   - In the Customer Requests admin page component (the page that opens when clicking "طلبات العملاء" from the sidebar), add a useEffect on mount that calls a service function like:
     - `markAllCustomerRequestsAsSeen()`
   - This function should:
     - update all requests in mockApi/localStorage so that:
       - isNew = false
       - seenAt = current timestamp
     - return the updated list.
   - After this function runs, update the local React state/context so that the UI reflects that there are no new requests.

3) Badge calculation:
   - Update the sidebar badge component for "طلبات العملاء" so that the badge value is:
     - the number of customer requests where `isNew === true`
     - NOT the total number of requests.
   - If the count of `isNew === true` is 0, hide the red badge entirely.

4) End-to-end test:
   - Create a new customer request so the badge shows 1.
   - Click "طلبات العملاء" in the sidebar:
     - The page should load, mark all requests as seen, and the badge should immediately become 0 / disappear.
   - Navigate to another page and back to "طلبات العملاء":
     - The badge should remain hidden (0) as long as there are no new requests.

5) If you already tried to implement this before, please review the logic to ensure:
   - The mark-as-seen function is actually called on page mount.
   - The sidebar is reading from the `isNew` flag, not from a static count.
   - There are no stale values cached in context or state.
