Implement the following behavior for the main part-number search bar on the customer landing page:

Goal:
When the customer types a part number (e.g. 00415441) and presses Enter or clicks the search button, the system should:
- silently log missing or out-of-stock parts into the admin "Missing" (النواقص) module
- show appropriate feedback to the customer, without telling them that the part was recorded in the missing list.

Please implement this exact logic:

1) Unified search trigger
   - The behavior must be identical for:
     a) pressing Enter in the search input
     b) clicking the search icon/button
   - Make sure both events call the same handler (e.g. handleSearchPartNumber).

2) Search logic
   - Use the existing catalog/products data (mockApi/localStorage) and search by part number.
   - There are three main cases:

   CASE A: Part not found in catalog
   --------------------------------
   - No product with this part number exists in the catalog.
   - For the customer UI:
     - Show a simple message like:
       "القطعة غير متوفرة حاليًا."
     - Do NOT mention that it is being recorded in the missing list.
   - For admin / Missing module:
     - Create a new record in the "Missing" (النواقص) data with:
       - partNumber (the searched number, e.g. 00415441)
       - customerId (if the user is logged in; otherwise store something like "guest" or null)
       - searchSource: "heroSearch"
       - status: "new" or similar
       - createdAt timestamp
       - any car info if available (make/model/year from the current context, optional)
     - If an identical missing record already exists for the same customer and partNumber on the same day, you can either:
       - update a counter, or
       - keep a single record (your choice, but avoid uncontrolled duplicates).

   CASE B: Part found but stock quantity = 0 (out of stock)
   --------------------------------------------------------
   - A product with this part number exists, but its quantity is 0 or below the available threshold.
   - For the customer UI:
     - Show the product information (name, brand, part number, image, etc.).
     - Do NOT show any price.
     - Show a clear message in Arabic like:
       "الكمية نفذت حاليًا من هذه القطعة."
   - For admin / Missing module:
     - Also create a missing record similar to CASE A, but with an additional field:
       - availabilityStatus: "out_of_stock"
     - This allows the admin to see that this is a known part but has no stock.
   - Again, avoid uncontrolled duplicates; you can merge or update an existing missing record for the same part/customer.

   CASE C: Part found and in stock (quantity > 0)
   ----------------------------------------------
   - Keep the existing behavior for showing available parts with prices, unless you already follow a different rule.
   - In this case, do not create a missing record.

3) Integration with Missing (النواقص) admin page
   - Ensure that records created in CASE A and CASE B appear in the admin "Missing" page:
     - part number
     - customer
     - createdAt
     - availabilityStatus (e.g. "not_found" vs "out_of_stock")
     - searchSource (heroSearch)
   - Update any badge/counter for the Missing page based on new records (isNew = true).

4) Silent behavior
   - Very important: the customer should NOT see any message saying:
     - "تم تحويل الطلب إلى النواقص" or "تم تسجيله في النواقص".
   - Only show:
     - "القطعة غير متوفرة حاليًا."  (for not found)
     - or "الكمية نفذت حاليًا من هذه القطعة." (for out of stock)
   - The recording into the Missing module must be purely internal on the backend/mock layer.

5) Technical details
   - Implement a dedicated helper/service function like:
     - `logMissingPart({ partNumber, customerId, availabilityStatus, searchSource })`
   - This function should be reused everywhere we need to log missing parts in the future.
   - Make sure TypeScript types are defined for MissingPart records and that everything compiles with no errors.

6) Testing
   - Test the three cases:
     A) Search for a completely unknown part number → show "غير متوفرة حاليًا" and create a Missing record.
     B) Search for a known part that has quantity 0 → show the item details without price + "الكمية نفذت حاليًا" and create a Missing record.
     C) Search for a known part with quantity > threshold → show normal available result with price and do NOT create a Missing record.
   - Verify that the Missing admin page shows the new records correctly.
