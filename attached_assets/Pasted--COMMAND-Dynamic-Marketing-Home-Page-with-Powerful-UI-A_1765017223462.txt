🔷 COMMAND — Dynamic Marketing Home Page with Powerful UI, Animated Sections, and Configurable Banners

IMPORTANT — This is an extension of the existing SINI CAR system.
Do NOT delete existing home page business logic or break current routing abruptly.
We are upgrading the main customer portal HOME page to a high-impact, marketing-focused, animated landing with configurable banners and layouts per customer type.

We now allow richer UI, stronger visual effects, and heavier frontend animations (even if they consume more CPU/RAM on the client side), as long as backend/API usage stays reasonable.

🎯 GOAL

Implement a dynamic, marketing-focused home page for logged-in B2B users.

Home page content, layout, and banners change based on the user’s customerType / role.

Home page features:

Strong visual design

Animated hero sections

Rotating / configurable banners

Highlights of key tools and benefits

Shortcuts to main actions and tools

Product search bar is removed from the home page and replaced with one or more strong CTAs linking to the dedicated Product Search page (Command 8).

1) Backend – Expose customer type and homepage configuration (with banners)
A) Ensure each user has a customerType / role

Each user must have a type that can drive UI decisions:

WORKSHOP

RENTAL

INSURANCE

SUPPLIER

MARKETER

(other types if needed)

This can be stored on the User model and/or in a related profile table.

B) Extend Settings (Command 12) for homepage layouts and banners

Use the existing Settings system (GlobalSetting / CustomerTypeSetting) to store homepage layouts and banners.

Introduce keys like:

homepage.layout

homepage.banners

Example homepage.layout for WORKSHOP:
{
  "heroTitle": "Tools and parts tailored for workshops",
  "heroSubtitle": "Fast quotations, easy re-orders, and smart tools for your workshop.",
  "showProductSearchShortcut": true,
  "showTraderTools": true,
  "showImportServices": false,
  "sectionsOrder": ["hero", "banners", "keyActions", "tools", "stats", "feedback"]
}

Example homepage.banners for WORKSHOP:
{
  "banners": [
    {
      "id": "banner-workshop-fast-quotes",
      "title": "Get workshop quotes in minutes",
      "subtitle": "Upload Excel or search parts and receive fast wholesale offers.",
      "imageUrl": "https://cdn.sini-car.com/banners/workshop-1.png",
      "backgroundColor": "#0F172A",
      "ctaLabel": "Upload Excel",
      "ctaLink": "/tools/upload-excel",
      "isActive": true,
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "banner-workshop-alternatives",
      "title": "Smart alternatives for your parts",
      "subtitle": "Find equivalent parts and cross references easily.",
      "imageUrl": "https://cdn.sini-car.com/banners/workshop-2.png",
      "backgroundColor": "#111827",
      "ctaLabel": "Open Alternatives",
      "ctaLink": "/alternatives",
      "isActive": true,
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}


Do the same for RENTAL, INSURANCE, SUPPLIER, MARKETER, each with different hero texts, banners, and section visibility.

If no CustomerTypeSetting exists for a given customerType, fall back to a global default layout + banners.

C) Endpoint: get effective homepage configuration

Create/extend an endpoint:

GET /api/homepage/config


Behavior:

Determine current user:

userId

role / customerType

Resolve settings using the Settings system (Command 12):

homepage.layout for this customerType

homepage.banners for this customerType

Optionally other keys (e.g. homepage.shortcuts, homepage.colors, etc.)

Return a config object:

{
  "customerType": "WORKSHOP",
  "layoutConfig": { ... },
  "bannersConfig": { ... },
  "shortcutsConfig": { ... }
}


This endpoint is read-heavy and should remain lightweight (single query or small number of queries).

2) Frontend – Home Page routing & base structure
A) Routing behavior

After login, B2B users (customers, suppliers, marketers) land on the new dynamic Home page.

Admin/staff retain a separate Admin Dashboard Home (different route, e.g. /admin).

B) Customer Home Page component

Route for customer portal home (e.g. / under customer layout).

On mount:

Call:

GET /api/homepage/config


Store the returned:

customerType

layoutConfig

bannersConfig

shortcutsConfig (if present)

The component should:

Use layoutConfig.sectionsOrder to control the order of rendered sections.

Use bannersConfig.banners to render a rich banner slider/hero.

3) Frontend – High-impact Home Page content per customer type

For all customer types:

Remove any direct product search bar from this Home page.

Instead, show a strong CTA (or multiple CTAs) like:

"Go to Product Search"

"Advanced Product Search"
→ Linking to the dedicated Product Search route (Command 8).

A) Common sections (used across most types)
1) HERO section (animated)

Full-width hero with:

Background gradient or image

Large heroTitle, heroSubtitle from layoutConfig

1–3 main CTAs:

"Create New Purchase Request"

"Upload Excel for Quotation"

"Go to Product Search"

UI Requirements:

Use modern, visually strong UI:

Big typography

Subtle parallax or motion (if desired)

Can use animation libraries (e.g. Framer Motion, GSAP, or similar) even if they are heavier, since this is a marketing-focused landing.

2) Banners/Carousel section

Use bannersConfig.banners to render:

A slider/carousel with:

Banner image

Title

Subtitle

CTA button

Background color

Support:

Auto-play

Manual navigation arrows / dots

Smooth transitions (fade, slide)

Banners must be:

Fully driven by settings (homepage.banners)

Easy to change from Settings UI later (Command 12)

Able to be shown/hidden via isActive flag.

3) Key Actions section

Grid of cards/buttons for main flows:

Request a quote

View previous requests/orders

Upload Excel (for quotation or price comparison)

Open Trader Tools (VIN, PDF → Excel, Comparison, Alternatives, etc.)

Cards can have:

Icons

Short description

Animated hover effects

Click to navigate to the appropriate route.

4) Tools & Services section

Highlight key tools:

VIN / forms recognition

Price comparison

Alternatives (بدائل الأصناف)

Import/wholesale services

Each tool card can include:

Icon / illustration

Short description

"Open tool" button

Add light animations (fade-in on scroll / slide from bottom).

5) Status / Overview mini-widgets

Optional, but recommended:

Show small KPI cards:

"Pending requests: X"

"Approved orders: Y"

"In progress: Z"

Simple, small components — no heavy charts required for this command.

6) Support / Feedback section

A section or card with:

"Send feedback / suggestion"

Opens a modal or side panel where user can type a message (to be wired to feedback API later).

Include light animations on open/close.

B) Workshop-specific content (customerType = WORKSHOP)

Text & imagery focusing on:

Fast quotations

Part availability for workshops

Easy re-orders for frequently used parts

Emphasize sections:

Request Quotation

Product Search shortcut

Alternatives

Recently requested parts (if easily available via existing APIs, otherwise placeholder).

C) Rental-specific content (RENTAL)

Focus text on:

Fleet maintenance

Bulk orders per vehicle group

Order history per fleet or contract

Emphasize:

Bulk Excel uploads

"Orders per vehicle" shortcuts

Tools for managing fleets.

D) Insurance-specific content (INSURANCE)

Focus text on:

Handling insurance claims

Managing multiple parallel requests

Emphasize:

"Upload claim Excel"

Tools for comparing multiple parts/options per claim.

E) Supplier Home (role = SUPPLIER)

Specialized home sections:

"View incoming requests"

"Upload / update my product list"

"View my offers / quotes"

Marketing text:

"Reach more B2B customers via SINI CAR."

Optionally show basic supplier stats:

Requests received

Quotes sent

Conversion rate (if data is easily available).

F) Marketer Home (role = MARKETER)

Sections:

"Your referral link"

Number of customers registered via this marketer

Number of orders from referred customers

Strong CTAs:

"Copy referral link"

"View performance report"

4) Animations and Dynamic Behavior (heavy UI allowed)

We explicitly allow strong, modern UI effects on the frontend:

Use animation libraries (e.g. Framer Motion, GSAP, Swiper, etc.) for:

Hero entrance animations

Banner slider transitions

Card hover and tap effects

Section reveal-on-scroll

Requirements:

Animations run on the client (browser).

No unnecessary additional load on the backend.

Avoid infinite heavy loops that constantly re-render or query APIs.

It is acceptable if the UI uses more CPU/RAM on the browser to achieve a rich visual experience.

5) Remove search bar from Home & link to Product Search

If the existing Home page contains a full product search bar:

Remove the search input + search logic from the Home page.

Instead:

Add one or more strong, clearly visible CTAs:

"Go to Product Search"

"Search products by part number"

These CTAs should navigate to the dedicated Product Search page from Command 8:

e.g. /product-search

The Product Search page remains the primary place for detailed product search.

6) Integration with Settings (Command 12)

Use homepage.layout and homepage.banners to control:

Which sections appear per customerType.

Text content (titles, subtitles).

Order of sections.

Banners list and their content.

Examples:

Workshops (customerType = WORKSHOP):

"sectionsOrder": ["hero", "banners", "keyActions", "tools", "stats", "feedback"]


Suppliers:

"sectionsOrder": ["hero", "supplierStats", "incomingRequests", "tools", "feedback"]


Admin should later be able to edit these settings via the Settings UI (Command 12).
For this command, focus on reading and rendering based on config.

7) Permissions and routing

This dynamic marketing Home page is for logged-in B2B users:

Customers

Suppliers

Marketers

If user is not logged in:

They should see the public marketing site or login page, not this internal Home.

Admin/staff can keep their existing admin dashboard Home under a separate route (/admin, etc.).

8) Multi-language (if already supported)

If multi-language (AR/EN/...) is already in place:

Texts on Home should:

Use translation keys

Or read localized strings from config

homepage.layout and homepage.banners may contain:

Either raw text

Or translation keys (e.g. "heroTitleKey": "home.workshop.heroTitle")

If multi-language is not fully implemented yet:

Design the structure to be ready for localization,

But do not overcomplicate this command.

9) Scope of this command

This command includes:

Backend:

Exposing homepage config per user (GET /api/homepage/config).

Using Settings (Command 12) for:

homepage.layout

homepage.banners

Potentially homepage.shortcuts.

Frontend:

A new dynamic, animated customer Home page:

Driven by config and customerType.

Rich, strong UI with banners and animations.

No product search bar on Home.

Clear CTAs linking to Product Search.

Different emphasis and content for:

Workshops

Rental

Insurance

Suppliers

Marketers

It does NOT:

Replace or modify the Admin dashboard Home.

Implement the Settings management UI (already covered in Command 12).

Change deep business logic; focus is on layout, content, visuals, and navigation.
