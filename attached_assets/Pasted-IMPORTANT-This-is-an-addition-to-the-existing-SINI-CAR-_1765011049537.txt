IMPORTANT — This is an addition to the existing SINI CAR system.
Do NOT delete or modify existing cart/quote logic. Only extend it.
Keep everything lightweight to reduce Replit compute cost.

GOAL:
Implement an "Abandoned Carts" system to track customers who added products
to a cart but did NOT submit the order.

1) Backend — Store abandoned carts
   - Locate where cart items are stored (mockApi/local storage or backend API).
   - Create a new backend model/table (if backend cart exists):
       • userId
       • items (JSON)
       • lastUpdatedAt
       • status ("ACTIVE" for abandoned, "CONVERTED" when submitted)
   - When a user adds items to cart but does NOT place an order:
       • Save/update this abandoned cart record.
   - When a user submits the order:
       • Mark the abandoned cart record as status = "CONVERTED".

2) Backend endpoint — GET abandoned carts
   - Create endpoint:
       GET /api/admin/abandoned-carts
   - Returns:
       • user info (name, whatsapp, role)
       • items list
       • lastUpdatedAt
       • status
   - Keep the response lightweight (no heavy joins) to reduce Replit cost.

3) Frontend — Admin Panel page
   - Create a new page: "Abandoned Carts" inside Admin panel.
   - Show table with:
       • customer name
       • whatsapp
       • number of items
       • lastUpdatedAt
       • action: "View Cart"
   - Clicking "View Cart":
       • Opens modal showing all products in that abandoned cart.

4) Frontend — minimize API calls
   - Load abandoned carts ONLY when the admin opens the page.
   - Do NOT auto-refresh or poll.
   - Store loaded data in React state and reuse it until user manually refreshes.

5) Behavior rules
   - A cart is considered abandoned if:
       • User added items
       • AND did not submit order
       • AND lastUpdatedAt is older than 15+ minutes
   - Do NOT use background jobs (Replit cost).
   - Only check “abandoned” status when:
       • Admin opens the abandoned carts page
       • OR user interacts with cart endpoints.

6) Permissions
   - Only Admin should access the abandoned-carts page.
   - Respect existing auth/role logic.

7) Replit cost rules
   - No cron jobs, no watchers, no AI calls.
   - Use minimal DB queries (1 list query + detailed modal query).
   - Keep payloads small.
